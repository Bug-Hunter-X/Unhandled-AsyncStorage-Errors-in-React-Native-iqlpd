This React Native code uses AsyncStorage to store user data. However, it doesn't handle potential errors during the asynchronous storage operations, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. Specifically, the `setItem` and `getItem` methods lack error handling, such as `try...catch` blocks.  This is especially problematic because AsyncStorage can throw errors if there are issues with the underlying storage mechanism (like full storage, permission problems).
